# Reactive Nutshell: The Information Dashboard

## What is Reactive Nutshell?

Nutshell is an app for people to use to organize their daily tasks, events, news article, friends, and chat messages.

## Team Members

Taryn Lytle, Dakota Upchurch, Jeremiah Schugt and Laurel Morrison

## The Goal
This group project's focus was to learn how to build a website with React. We were tasked with issue tickets from the "client" including:

1. The user can add friends and see their friend's articles and events.
1. The logged-in user is the only one with ability to edit/delete friends, events, messages (private and public) and tasks.
1. Display today's weather on the homepage, and date-specific weather on the event cards. If it's too far in the future, then show today's with an error message.
1. Be able to create task and have a checkbox that allows you to mark them complete.
1. Private messages should be able to be sent directly to a friend, and only they can see it. 
1. Public messages should be displayed on the dashboard and everyone can read them.
